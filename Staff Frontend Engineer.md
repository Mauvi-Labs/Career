# Staff Frontend Engineer

We're seeking a Staff/Lead Frontend Engineer who will play a critical role in building and scaling our first flagship consumer product: Mauvi. 

### Mauvi Labs

Mauvi Labs, Inc. is an applied AI research company. Our long-term goal is to develop general-purpose human-level multimodal models that are capable of (complex visual) reasoning and understanding. We're pushing every boundary to develop novel machine learning architectures and compelling social consumer products. 

To help bring this vision to reality, we're building Mauvi, a creative suite that turns filmmaking, video and music production into a fun! social experience using a suite of AI models to give the creative class a new kind of camera and production techniques that eliminate the need for expensive filming equipment and music recording studios. Join us.

### Job Requirements 

- Proven track record in building cross-platform consumer products for millions of users.
- Extensive knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and experience with web and app development frameworks such as React, and Next.js. Experience with Three.js is a plus.
- Interest in shaping novel AI-native (dynamic) user interfaces, which requires integrating an understanding of AI vision models with your Frontend development skills. This process has a steep learning curve, so we encourage you to approach it with curiosity. Experience with Python is a great advantage. 
- Familiarity with modern development best practices and workflows, and a willingness to help shape our development processes including using AI coding agents and co-pilots.
- We approach UI engineering as a challenge that requires balancing technical workflows with an innate or cultivated sense of aesthetics, and the ability to turn AI research into features that help steer foundation models.
- A commitment to high standards and the eagerness to iterate on your solutions. We prioritize delivering a high-quality compelling user experience over shipping products that make no difference.
- A genuine interest in the history of filmmaking, cinematic techniques, or music production is cool to have, but not a must.

### Application Process 

Please send an email to hello@mauvi.xyz that includes a link to previous work, your portfolio and a brief description of past achievements. Once we get a chance to read your application, we'll invite you to a Zoom interview to discuss the role and understand your expectations and what you're looking for in your next role. 

We value direct and clear communication, kindness and curisoty, and an intuitive yet rigorous approach to crack out extraordinary solutions. Please reach out, we're excited to meet you.
